      You might be struggling with one or more of life's countless challenges:
      **Anxiety** that steals your peace.
      **Depression** that steals your joy.
      **Burnout** that steals your energy.
      **Transitions** that steal your identity.
      **Menopause** that changes everything.
      **Health fears** that dominate your mind.
      **Physical illness** that limits your life.
      **Self-doubt** that holds you back.
      **Young people** who are struggling.
      **Neurodiversity** that makes you feel different.

      **I'm Vicky, an integrative psychotherapist with almost 20 years as an NHS GP behind me.** I understand both the emotional weight you're carrying and the physical reality of what you're experiencing.

      Here's what matters: you've been incredibly strong to get this far. You are facing real difficulties, and the strategies that have served you well are not enough anymore. I work with you with both passion and the compassion of someone who has walked the paths and rebuilt - and the professional expertise to help you find your way through.

      There is something deeply rewarding about witnessing clients rediscover their spark - that moment when they realise they have more strength than they knew. When making changes feels possible rather than overwhelming. When clients start to genuinely enjoy life again. **Together, you and I will uncover the strengths you already have and build a clear path forward with strategies that benefit you and your life.**
