      Are you facing challenges, changes or choices - and finding that previous strategies just aren't helping anymore?
      
      I'm Vicky, an integrative psychotherapist with almost 20 years as an NHS GP behind me. I understand both the emotional weight you're carrying and the physical reality of what you're experiencing.
      
      You might be struggling with one or more of life's countless challenges:
      Anxiety that steals your peace.
      Depression that steals your joy.
      Burnout that steals your energy.
      Transitions that steal your identity.
      Menopause that changes everything.
      Health fears that dominate your mind.
      Physical illness that limits your life.
      Self-doubt that holds you back.
      Young people who are struggling.
      Neurodiversity that makes you feel different.
