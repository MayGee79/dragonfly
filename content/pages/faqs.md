      ## 1. What kinds of issues can therapy help with?
      At Dragonfly Psychotherapy, I work with a wide range of challenges, including
      anxiety, depression, burnout, menopause-related change, low self-esteem,
      relationship difficulties, and life transitions. I also support people navigating health-
      related fears or chronic illness, and those exploring neurodiversity or parenting
      young people who are struggling. My aim is always to help you rediscover your
      spark, build confidence, and find a sustainable way forward.

      ## 2. What makes your approach different
      My background as both a former NHS GP and a psychotherapist means I
      understand how closely emotional and physical wellbeing are linked. I combine
      medical insight with psychological expertise to offer a truly holistic approach. Clients
      often say this combination helps them feel deeply understood, both as a person and
      as a whole system - mind and body.

      ## 3. What does "integrative psychotherapy" mean?
      Being an integrative therapist means I don't use a one-size-fits-all model. I draw from
      several approaches - including CBT, psychodynamic, person-centred, and
      mindfulness-based methods - depending on your goals and needs. Together, we'll
      develop a plan that feels right for you, and this may evolve as your therapy
      progresses.

      ## 4. Who do you work with?
      I work with adults and young people (usually aged 11 and over). My approach is
      flexible and can adapt to the individual - whether that's a teen navigating school
      stress, a woman experiencing the impact of menopause, or someone facing burnout,
      loss, or change.

      ## 5. What happens in the first session?
      Your first session is a chance for us to explore what's brought you to therapy and
      what you hope to gain. It's also an opportunity for you to get a sense of whether I'm
      the right fit for you. Many clients tell me they feel relieved just to start the
      conversation - there's no pressure, no expectation to have everything figured out.

      ## 6. How long does therapy take?
      There's no fixed timeline - therapy moves at your pace. Some people find a few
      months of focused sessions helpful, while others prefer longer-term work. We'll
      review your progress regularly and adjust according to what feels most supportive for
      you.

      ## 7. Do you offer online therapy?
      Yes. You can choose to have sessions face-to-face in Guildford or Horsley in Surrey,
      or remotely online or telephone. Many clients appreciate the flexibility to combine
      both, depending on their week.

      ## 8. How much does therapy cost?
      Sessions cost £95 for 50 minutes. I also offer 75-minute single-session therapy at
      £140, which can be useful for focused work or as a stand-alone consultation. A free
      15-minute initial phone or online conversation is available to help you decide if we're
      a good fit.

      ## 9. Is therapy confidential?
      Yes - confidentiality is central to the therapeutic process. What you share stays
      private, except in rare legal or safeguarding situations, which I will always explain
      clearly. Creating a safe, trusting space is the foundation of our work together.

      ## 10. Where are you based?
      I work from Guildford Therapy Rooms (GU2 9JX), and East Horsley (KT24 5EH). All
      are easily accessible from Cobham, Godalming, Leatherhead, Dorking, Esher and
      the surrounding Surrey Hills.

      ## 11. How do I know if therapy is right for me?
      If you're feeling anxious, low, overwhelmed, or simply stuck, therapy can help you
      find clarity and strength. You don't need to be in crisis - therapy is also about
      personal growth and rediscovering what makes life meaningful. I offer a free
      conversation so you can ask questions and get a sense of whether it feels right for
      you.

      ## 12. What can I expect to gain from therapy?
      Clients tell me that therapy helps them:
      - Understand themselves more deeply
      - Develop tools that work in real life
      - Feel calmer and more resilient
      - Reconnect with their strengths and values
      - Experience a greater sense of hope and direction
      My goal is for you to leave each session feeling a little more equipped - and a little
      less alone.

      ## 13. How do I book a session?
      You can contact me directly via the contact form, by email at
      victoria@dragonflypsychotherapy.co.uk, or by phone on 07546 431 448. I'll
      respond personally and arrange a convenient time to talk.

      ## 14. Are you accredited?
      I am a registered member of the British Association for Counselling and
      Psychotherapy (BACP, member number 402603) and work in line with their ethical
      framework.

      ## 15. Why "Dragonfly" Psychotherapy?
      The dragonfly symbolises transformation and adaptability. It captures the essence of
      therapy - rediscovering your ability to grow, adapt, and move through change. I
      believe that no matter how stuck life feels, there's always potential for
      transformation.
