subtitle: Your Therapist & Ally
introText1: My journey from NHS GP to psychotherapist wasn't just a career change - it was recognition that lasting change happens when we understand both the emotional and physical sides of our struggles.
introText2: This rich background gives me a broad and deep understanding of both the emotional and physical aspects of health, allowing me to bring a truly integrative perspective to my practice, and combine therapeutic skills and medical knowledge to offer something unique.
