mainTitle: Our work together
subtitle: Simple, Flexible, Tailored to You
introText: |
  I'm an integrative therapist - which means I draw from a range of different skills - including CBT, psychodynamic, person-centred and mindfulness approaches. This blend will depend on any specific issues or goals that we have identified for you and may well adjust over the course of our work, creating a plan unique for you. There are no generic one-size-fits-all solutions.

  Central to my approach is helping you recognise strengths you may have forgotten you have. Often when life is difficult, we lose sight of our capabilities. Together, we'll uncover and build upon the strengths that have carried you this far - even if you can't see them right now.

    title: Free 15-Minute Chat
    subtitle: No pressure. Let's see if we're a good fit.
    description: We can talk through the difficulties you are experiencing and whether there is something you are hoping to achieve. It's okay if there isn't something specific, sometimes it feels too complicated to untangle everything at first. We can talk through how we might be able to work together.

    title: Your First Session
    subtitle: We'll explore what's bringing you here and create a plan together.
    description: "If you decide that you would like to work together with me on your difficulties, we will arrange an initial assessment appointment. This and subsequent sessions are 50 minutes in length.\n\nIn the initial assessment, I am seeking to get a much more in depth understanding of your difficulties, in order for us to be able to make a plan for working jointly towards your goals.\n\nOur sessions would be collaborative and tailored to your specific aims - whether you're looking for immediate relief from stress, seeking to understand and repair from past experiences, or working towards long-term personal growth."
